# 'make depend' uses makedepend to automatically generate dependencies

# 'make'        build executable file 'mycc'
# 'make clean'  removes all .o and executable files

CFLAGS =  -Wall -g -std=c++11 -O3

#
# INCLUDES = -I/home/stens/include  -I../include

# define library paths in addition to /usr/lib
#   if I wanted to include libraries not in /usr/lib I'd specify
#   their path using -Lpath, something like:
# LFLAGS = -L/home/stens/lib  -L../lib

# define any libraries to link into executable:
#   if I want to link in libraries (libx.so or libx.a) I use the -llibname 
#   option, something like (this will link in libmylib.so and libm.so:
LIBS = -lGL -lGLU -lopenal -lGLEW -lm -lglfw -lpthread

# with the .o suffix
